# InferentialStatsExercise2
This exercise strives to answer the question of whether employers discriminate based on an applicant's name. Black-sounding names were assigned to half of the sample, and white-sounding names to the other half. The calls made to applicants were analyzed using 2-sample hypothesis testing to determine if the data supported the existence of this type of discrimination.
